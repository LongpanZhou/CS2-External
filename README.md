### Introduction
This project is a proof of concept for using Discord overlay for rendering. The reason for this approach is that some anti-cheat systems detect suspicious window creation, which can trigger a flag or ban. By using whitelisted applications like Discord for rendering, we can avoid creating new windows or triggering suspicious activity, effectively bypassing detection.

In some relution of the game will have screen teraing, not sure what the cause its therefore its not been fixed yet.
